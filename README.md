# The (Unofficial) McGill Course Searcher

Disclaimer: This is not an official McGill tool. This experimental utility was developed as a part of a summer project on semantic/vector search engines by Rishi Nair (McGill '27). This search engine uses the SBERT 'all-mpnet-base-v2' sentence transformer model, and the FAISS library developed by Facebook.

You can access this app at https://huggingface.co/spaces/rishinair05/McGill_Course_Search.

You can enter your query as words or sentences. (e.g., 'Courses on Machine Learning', 'Newton's Method', 'Pizza', 'Metallica', etc.)

Note that the embedding model used in this code can sometimes overlook important keywords. If you already know the course code and/or title, it may be better to use the official McGill course search engine available at https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2023-2024/courses/search.


If you encounter any issues or you have any suggestions, please email rishi.nair(AT)mail.mcgill.ca or file an issue on the github repository at https://github.com/rishinair05/McGill_Course_Search. If you have found this tool useful, feel free to star the github repository. Cheers, Rishi.
